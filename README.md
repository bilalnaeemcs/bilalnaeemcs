# Hello, I'm [Bilal Naeem](https://bilalnaeem.netlify.app)! üë®‚Äçüíª

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Computer Science enthusiast with a Master's from Purdue University and a Bachelor's from LUMS. My passion lies in finding efficient and effective solutions to complex and interesting problems. Here, you'll find the projects I've poured my heart and soul into, ranging from virtualization innovations to developing secure, efficient software systems.


## üí° Projects
Below are some highlights of my work. Feel free to dive in and explore!

- **[HyperODF](https://github.com/martianbilal/hyperodf)**: Reduces VM clone time by 98%, making cloud computing much more efficient. It includes changes to the Linux Kernel, QEMU/KVM, and Kata Containers.
- **[kvmhost-fork](https://github.com/martianbilal/kvm-host-fork)**: Implements a VM fork mechanism similar to HyperODF, but tailored for KVMHost, a simpler hypervisor. This project is ideal for testing, prototyping, and playing with virtualization technology.
- **[Recollect](/recollect)**: This innovative system boosts AFLGo's efficiency by 9-200x, making software debugging a breeze.

## üåü Random Interesting stuff
Here's a sneak peek into some projects that are a mix of brain teasers, productivity hacks, and my digital playground:

- **[LLVM Examples](https://github.com/martianbilal/llvm-examples)**: Ever wonder what goes on under the hood of your C++ code? Me too!
- **[TwoX OneDrive](https://github.com/martianbilal/twox_onedrive)**: This Chrome extension based on a simple hack is for 2x-ing my way through lectures. Because who has the time to watch videos at normal speed?
- **[DHT Peer-to-Peer Content Sharing](https://github.com/martianbilal/DHT)**: This project is my take on a DHT-based peer-to-peer content sharing application.
- **[MartianBilal.github.io](https://github.com/martianbilal/martianbilal.github.io)**: Checkout my personal blog, where I seldom share interesting tips, tricks, and some random opinions.
