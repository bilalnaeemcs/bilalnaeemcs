# Hello, I'm [Bilal Naeem](https://bilalnaeem.netlify.app)! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Computer Science enthusiast with a Master's from Purdue University and a Bachelor's from LUMS. My passion lies in finding efficient and effective solutions to complex and interesting problems. Here, you'll find the projects I've poured my heart and soul into, ranging from virtualization innovations to developing secure, efficient software systems.


## 💡 Projects
Below are some highlights of my work. Feel free to dive in and explore!

- **[HyperODF](https://github.com/martianbilal/hyperodf)**: Reduces VM clone time by 98%, making cloud computing much more efficient. It includes changes to Linux Kernel, QEMU/KVM, and Kata Containers.
- - **[kvmhost-fork](https://github.com/martianbilal/kvm-host-fork)**: Implements a VM fork mechanism similar to HyperODF, but tailored for KVMHost, a simpler hypervisor. This project is ideal for testing, prototyping, and playing with virtualization technology.
- **[Recollect](/recollect)**: This innovative system boosts AFLGo's efficiency by 9-200x, making software debugging a breeze.
